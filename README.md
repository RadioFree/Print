# Print
This is a wordpress plugin that allows for any post to be printed in a clean two-column responsive layout with in-line link citations.  It adds a print button to the bottom of each post which will load a new version of the post when clicked.  The new page can be printed to make non-traditional newspaper style publications for the dissemination of information.

To install the plugin, download the zip file (included in the list of files) and upload it to WordPress.  If you are confused about that process, here's a great resource on understanding plugins for WordPress. https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/
