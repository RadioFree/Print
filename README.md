# Print
This is a wordpress plugin that allows for any post to be printed in a clean two-column responsive layout with in-line link citations.  It adds a print button to the bottom of each post which will load a new version of the post when clicked.  The new page can be printed to make non-traditional newspaper style publications for the dissemination of information.
